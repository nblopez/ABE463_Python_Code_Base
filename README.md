# ABE463_Python_Code_Base
This GitHub Repository will be used as the python code base for ABE463 (Electrohydraulics).

Dr. Tony Grift of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign teaches a class on the interaction of software and hydraulic test benches as a technical elective for Juniors and Seniors. While the course is mainly taught using MatLab, LabView, and National Instruments 6009 DAQs, some students are already well-versed in those softwares and are taking on the challenge to carry out the labs using Python.

National Instruments has already provided the NI-DAQmx modules that we will need to have basic interaction with our test benches before continuing deeper into the class. (https://nidaqmx-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
